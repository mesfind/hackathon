I gained practical skills in building and analyzing compartmental models (e.g., SIR) to understand disease transmission dynamics. The intensive program honed my ability to interpret model outputs for forecasting and policy assessment, solidifying my foundation in applying mathematical principles to real-world public health challenges.","My application to this hackathon is on to apply the advanced modelling skills after  I acquired at the training  directly to a real and public health context. The chance to work with the NDMC at EPHI will be particularly compelling, as this represents an opportunity to make contributions at the very heart of public health decision-making in Ethiopia.

I am very excited to move from the theoretical exercises to applying real data at the national level to solve real problems, such as disease outbreak forecasting. The collaboration with experts at NDMC and public health professionals would bring insights that are incredibly valuable into the practical subtlety of model application within a specific health system. This hackathon is the perfect opportunity to bridge my international training with on-the-ground actionability, in service of EPHI's critical mission to protect population health in Ethiopia.
","I am motivated to participate because I recognize the critical shortage of skilled disease modellers and public health personnel, a gap I am dedicated to helping fill. The training I received at Oxford has equipped me with a robust skill set that I am eager to apply directly to Ethiopia's public health challenges.

More importantly, I hope to learn from NDMC experts about the on-the-ground realities, so I can better tailor my skills to support EPHI's vital mission and become part of the solution to this personnel shortage.","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Epidemic forecasting and preparedness","Reflecting on the challenge of identifying zero-dose children, I believe data-driven modelling is transformative. By integrating fragmented data sources—like routine health facility reports, satellite imagery on remote settlements, and mobile network data—we can move beyond static coverage maps.

A dynamic model can pinpoint persistent ""cold spots"" and predict population movements that create temporary access barriers. For instance, a Bayesian geospatial model could fuse historical immunization data with real-time mobility patterns to identify high-risk villages seasonally cut off by floods. This allows for proactive, targeted micro-plans and mobile vaccination campaigns, ensuring resources reach the most vulnerable communities efficiently, ultimately closing the equity gap in immunization.","Policy Question: How can Ethiopia optimally deploy a limited number of mobile vaccination teams to maximize the identification and immunization of ""zero-dose"" children in the Somali Region?

Importance: Fixed health facilities often miss remote, pastoralist populations. This leads to persistent zero-dose children who are most vulnerable to outbreaks. An inefficient deployment of mobile teams wastes scarce resources and leaves the hardest-to-reach children behind. A strategic plan is critical for equity and effectiveness.

Data & Modelling Approach: I would use a spatial optimization model. Key data would include: historical vaccination coverage, population estimates from satellite night-light imagery, settlement locations, and road networks.

Data-driven modelling can play a transformative role in strengthening Ethiopia’s immunization programs by identifying gaps in coverage and pinpointing zero-dose children. By integrating demographic, geographic, and health service utilization data, predictive models can highlight underserved communities and reveal patterns of inequity across regions. For example, spatial mapping combined with machine learning can identify clusters of children who have never received vaccines, while incorporating socioeconomic indicators can uncover barriers such as distance to health facilities, parental education, or mobility constraints.

Such models not only improve targeting of outreach campaigns but also support evidence-based resource allocation. They can guide the Ministry of Health in prioritizing districts with the highest risk of outbreaks due to low coverage, ensuring that interventions are both efficient and equitable. Importantly, transparent visualization tools can empower local health workers and policymakers to monitor progress, adapt strategies in real time, and build accountability.

Ultimately, data-driven modelling offers a pathway to close immunization gaps, protect vulnerable populations, and accelerate Ethiopia’s progress toward universal health coverage.","Policy Question: How can data-driven modelling identify and reduce inequities in immunization coverage among zero-dose children in Ethiopia?

Why is it important? Zero-dose children—those who have never received any vaccines—remain highly vulnerable to preventable diseases and contribute to persistent health inequities. In Ethiopia, geographic, socioeconomic, and health system barriers often leave marginalized communities underserved. Addressing this gap is critical for achieving universal immunization coverage, reducing child mortality, and meeting global health targets. Moreover, focusing on zero-dose children strengthens trust in health systems and ensures that no population is left behind.

Data and Modelling Approach:

Data sources: Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) records, geographic information systems (GIS), socioeconomic indicators, and health facility accessibility data.

Modelling approach:

Spatial modelling to map clusters of zero-dose children.

Predictive analytics using machine learning to identify risk factors (e.g., distance to facilities, parental education, mobility).

Scenario modelling to test targeted interventions (mobile clinics, outreach campaigns).

Visualization dashboards for policymakers to monitor progress and adapt strategies in real time.

However, scattered data, delayed reporting, and reactive reaction tactics restrict its efficacy.  In order to minimize morbidity and death during epidemics and to allocate resources in a timely manner, it is imperative that its predictive power be strengthened.

Data and Modeling Approach: Using machine learning and Bayesian forecasting, I suggest combining PHEM surveillance data with reports on health facilities, mobility, and climate to create time-series and geographic models.

This challenge area is critically important because the dynamics of diseases like malaria and dengue are inherently complex and multidimensionally driven. Traditional surveillance, which tracks case numbers retrospectively, is no longer sufficient for proactive intervention. The power of this approach lies in integrating disparate data streams to move from reaction to prediction.

The Core Idea: We can model disease risk as a function of environment (climate data creating breeding sites), human vulnerability (mobility patterns exposing new populations), and existing pathogen presence (surveillance data confirming transmission).

Proposed Modelling Approach:

1. Data Integration Layer: Fuse satellite-derived climate data (precipitation, temperature, humidity), anonymized mobile phone data for mobility estimates, and real-time case reports from health facilities. A common geographical and temporal scale (e.g., district-level, weekly) is key.
2. Model Architecture: A machine learning model, such as a Gradient Boosting Regressor or a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, would be ideal. The LSTM is particularly powerful as it can learn from sequences of past data to forecast future outbreak risk.
3. Actionable Output: The model would generate a continuously updated ""Risk Map"" – a visual tool for health officials. This map would highlight districts or sub-districts forecasted to have high transmission potential in the coming 2-4 weeks.

Value for the Ministry of Health:
This model transforms public health strategy.Instead of broadly distributing resources, the Ministry can conduct targeted, pre-emptive campaigns:

· Deploying bed nets and insecticides to high-risk areas before the peak season.
· Directing community health workers to conduct fever screening in specific predicted hotspots.
· Optimizing the allocation of diagnostic tests and antimalarial drugs to the regions that will need them most.

By weaving together climate, mobility, and surveillance data, we can create a dynamic early-warning system that allows health systems to get ahead of the transmission cycle, ultimately saving lives and resources.","How can we optimally re-design the catchment areas of health posts to improve the equity and efficiency of community health worker(CHW) services in a region, ensuring all communities, especially remote ones, have timely access?

Fixed catchment areas can become outdated,leading to unequal workloads for CHWs and leaving ""last-mile"" populations underserved. This directly impacts primary care outcomes, from vaccination rates to maternal health. Optimizing these areas ensures limited CHW resources are deployed fairly and effectively, targeting the hardest-to-reach children and families.

We would usegeospatial data (health post locations, settlement points, population density, terrain/travel times) and health service data (current workload, zero-dose children locations).

The modelling approach would be a location-allocation analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This optimization model would redefine catchment boundaries by minimizing travel time for the population and balancing the number of people or target children (e.g., zero-dose) assigned to each health post, ensuring equitable coverage.",Yes,Yes,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1sTpLqJ2wiTygNA-KJ4yacrRCYB46pzpY

Improving Immunization Coverage and Identifying Zero-Dose Children
I believe data-driven modelling can play a vital role in closing immunization gaps in Ethiopia. By combining demographic, geographic, and health service data, we can uncover where zero-dose and under-immunized children are located and understand why they are being missed. Using predictive and geospatial models, I hope to support the design of targeted, evidence-based interventions that make vaccine delivery more equitable and ensure that no child is left behind.
2. Forecasting and Preparedness for Epidemic Outbreaks
I am particularly interested in how data models and visualization tools can strengthen epidemic preparedness. By integrating real-time surveillance, mobility, and climate data, it becomes possible to forecast potential outbreaks and identify early warning signals. I believe tools such as dashboards and spatial maps can help the Ministry of Health respond more swiftly and effectively at both regional and district levels, preventing local outbreaks from becoming national threats.
3. Modelling Vector-Borne Diseases Using Climate, Mobility, and Surveillance Data
My interest in vector-borne disease modelling comes from seeing how climate and mobility influence malaria transmission in many regions of Ethiopia. By linking climatic, mobility, and surveillance data, we can develop predictive models that identify emerging risk zones. I hope to contribute to approaches that help anticipate outbreaks before they occur, guiding more focused interventions and strengthening national disease control strategies.
4. Optimizing Supply Chain Allocation for Public Health Programs
I believe data-driven modelling can greatly enhance the efficiency of public health supply chains. Through optimization and simulation models, we can forecast demand, reduce stockouts, and improve the distribution of essential medicines and vaccines. I am especially interested in exploring how real-time logistics data can guide smarter allocation decisions, ensuring that critical supplies reach every health facility on time and resources are used effectively.","1) Public Health Policy Question:
How can data-driven modelling be used to identify and reduce zero-dose children in rural Ethiopia?
2) Why it is Important:
Many children in remote communities remain unvaccinated, increasing their vulnerability to preventable diseases and reflecting persistent inequities in health access. Addressing this challenge is essential for achieving universal immunization coverage and improving child health outcomes.
3) Data and Modelling Approach:
I plan to use geospatial and predictive modelling by integrating demographic, health facility, and mobility data.

What is the problem or policy question?
I think it's interesting to consider how we might identify children who are not receiving any vaccines, what we would call zero-dose children, and effectively target these children. How will we use data to find the zero-dose children? What does the data tell us are the barriers to getting them vaccinated?

2. Why is it important?

This is important, as children who miss vaccines have a higher susceptibility to these preventable diseases, and it affects community health as well. If we don't reach these kids, outbreaks can happen even when overall vaccination rates look okay. By knowing where and why kids are missing vaccines, policies can be more focused and resources used better in saving lives. 3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it? We could use data from household surveys, health facility records, and geographic information such as distance to clinics or travel routes. Models of spatial risk mapping, predictive modeling, or machine learning can show where the high-risk areas are and what drives zero-dose children.

However, I often observed how limited modelling capacity constrained our ability to anticipate outbreaks and target interventions effectively.

Participating in this hackathon presents an opportunity to bridge that gap, to learn practical modelling techniques, and collaborate with interdisciplinary experts who translate data into real-time insights. I am particularly interested in learning how public health modeling can be used to predict outbreak and epidemic trends, optimize vaccination strategies, and evaluate interventions in resource-limited settings. This hackathon aligns perfectly with my goal of integrating modelling into applied field epidemiology to improve health outcomes and policy decisions.
","I will contribute my experience in outbreak response, data interpretation for surveillance, and immunization program management, particularly in the contexts of cholera, measles, and polio. I can bring a practical perspective on how models can be applied to real-world public health challenges, including data gaps and operational constraints in field settings.

At the same time, I aim to learn from data scientists and modellers how to build, validate, and communicate models effectively. I am particularly keen to understand epidemic forecasting tools, scenario modelling, and how to integrate model outputs into decision-making. By the end of this event, I aim to acquire hands-on skills and establish networks that will enable me to translate modeling insights into actionable strategies for epidemic prevention and control.
","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Epidemic forecasting and preparedness","1. Epidemic forecasting is crucial for timely preparedness and response, particularly in regions with recurrent outbreaks. From my coordination of surveillance and outbreak investigations work, I have seen how delayed detection and reporting often leads to avoidable spread of a disease. Data-driven modelling can fill this gap by integrating real-time surveillance, climate, and population data to predict hotspots/high-risk areas and guide early interventions.

2. Tools such as time-series forecasting and geospatial visualization dashboards can help the Ministry of Health and its partners identify areas of high risk, allocate resources efficiently, and plan outbreak response and reactive immunization campaigns.

3.  Integrating climate variables (rainfall, temperature, humidity) with mobility data (population flows, urban density) and surveillance data can help model spatial–temporal transmission patterns and anticipate outbreaks before they escalate.

We can use geospatial models to map hotspot areas, forecast mosquito breeding peaks, and inform targeted interventions, such as larval source management or insecticide distribution. Developing Dashboards that overlay these data streams would allow health authorities to make timely, evidence-based decisions and respond accordingly.

4. Robust supply-chain systems are critical for ensuring the timely delivery of vaccines and other medical commodities to last-mile communities and to identify bottlenecks in distribution, forecast demand, and optimize allocation based on disease burden and geographic access.

By combining data on population size, storage capacity, transport routes, and outbreak trends, such models can help the MOH and its partners design adaptive supply-chain strategies that reduce waste and stockouts, leading to missed opportunities.

From field experience in immunization logistics and outbreak coordination lens, I recognize how these modeling tools can increase accountability and transparency at the community level reach, ensuring that service delivery points receive the right supplies at the right time.
","1. Cholera remains endemic in parts of the Horn of Africa region, where outbreaks recur due to poor water, sanitation, and climate variability. Given the global stockpile shortage of the OCV vaccines, identifying when and where to deploy vaccines remains reactive rather than predictive. The question is: How can modelling be used to forecast cholera outbreaks and guide timely, targeted OCV interventions?

2. Improving outbreak forecasting could enable MOH and health partners to pre-position supplies, mobilize rapid-response teams, and vaccinate populations before epidemics escalate. 

3. Integrating surveillance data, rainfall and temperature data, and population mobility patterns through spatial–temporal models or machine-learning prediction algorithms can help identify high-risk districts weeks in advance. Visualization dashboards could then translate predictions into actionable insights for policymakers.",Yes,Yes,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=190xpt8kMWcw3hqtkUt1mBHJf_E-8dq20

It will also familiarize me with applied modeling approaches relevant to public health research, directly supporting my PhD work. I am eager to learn how interdisciplinary perspectives can improve model accuracy and applicability, enhancing both the quality and impact of my research.
","Epidemic forecasting and preparedness, Health systems optimization and resource allocation","Forecasting and preparing for epidemic outbreaks requires at all levels   combination of predictive modeling and interactive visualization tools. Compartmental models such as SEIR (Susceptible–Exposed–Infectious–Recovered) and agent-based models can simulate disease dynamics across different population segments, accounting for transmission rates, vaccination coverage, and mobility patterns. These models can be calibrated using historical epidemiological data to generate area-specific forecasts.
To support decision-making, visualization dashboards such as R Shiny, Tableau, or Power BI can integrate real-time surveillance data, enabling the Ministry of Health to track trends, hotspots, and intervention impacts dynamically. Spatial mapping tools like ArcGIS or QGIS can further highlight district-level risks, identify vulnerable populations, and guide resource allocation.
By combining predictive modeling with interactive visualization, health authorities can not only anticipate outbreaks but also optimize targeted interventions, improve resource planning, and communicate risks effectively. This approach directly aligns with my PhD research in epidemiology and will enhance my skills in applied public health modeling, ultimately contributing to evidence-based decision-making.
","How can district-level predictive models improve timely interventions for epidemic outbreaks, such as cholera or measles, in Ethiopia?
Outbreaks can overwhelm local health systems and disproportionately affect vulnerable populations. Timely, data-driven interventions are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality.
Data and Modelling Approach: Integrate historical epidemiological, demographic, climate, and mobility data to develop SEIR or agent-based models at the district level.

I am particularly inspired by the challenge focusing on how climate, mobility, and surveillance data can be integrated to model vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue. In Ethiopia, the transmission of malaria is highly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity, as well as population movement patterns and health service access. Data-driven models that combine these diverse datasets can provide powerful insights for predicting outbreak hotspots, timing, and transmission intensity.

My current PhD research focuses on applying hybrid deep learning and machine learning models for malaria outbreak prediction and spatiotemporal clustering in the Oromia Region. This experience positions me to explore innovative approaches that fuse climatic, mobility, and health surveillance data for real-time risk prediction. By contributing to this hackathon, I aim to design explainable AI models and dynamic visualization dashboards that can help policymakers and health workers make evidence-based, proactive interventions to prevent and control malaria in vulnerable communities.","
Policy Question: How can predictive modelling be used to identify high-risk districts for malaria outbreaks in Ethiopia to enable targeted and timely intervention?

Importance: Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Ethiopia, with transmission highly variable across regions and seasons. Current control strategies often rely on historical incidence data, which may delay interventions and lead to inefficient allocation of limited resources. Addressing this policy question is critical to improving outbreak preparedness, optimizing resource distribution, and reducing morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable and rural communities.

Data and Modelling Approach: To explore this question, I would integrate multiple data sources, including historical malaria case data, climate variables (temperature, rainfall, humidity), population mobility patterns, land use, and health service accessibility. A hybrid modelling approach combining machine learning (e.g., random forest, gradient boosting) with spatial-temporal statistical models can be applied to predict high-risk districts. Visualization tools such as interactive dashboards and risk maps can help policymakers interpret the results and plan timely interventions. This approach aligns with evidence-based public health strategies, strengthening Ethiopia’s capacity to prevent and respond to malaria outbreaks proactively.",Yes,No,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LWAln5oE2ysYtPNaKZBlzXBiYw30o2yJ

","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Health systems optimization and resource allocation","Data-driven modelling can play a transformative role in improving immunization coverage and identifying zero-dose children in Ethiopia. By integrating demographic, geographic, and health service data, predictive models can pinpoint regions and populations at highest risk of under-immunization. These models help visualize spatial disparities, forecast vaccine demand, and identify factors such as distance to health facilities, socioeconomic barriers, or conflict-affected areas that contribute to missed vaccinations.

Machine learning and geospatial modelling can further refine targeting by predicting zero-dose clusters, enabling health authorities to design more equitable outreach campaigns. Real-time data dashboards can track progress, optimize resource allocation, and monitor cold-chain efficiency. Moreover, scenario-based modelling supports policymakers in testing intervention strategies—such as mobile clinics or community health worker deployment—before implementation.

Ultimately, data-driven modelling provides actionable insights that make immunization programs more precise, efficient, and inclusive—ensuring no child is left unvaccinated due to systemic gaps or inequities.
","**Public Health Policy Question:**
How can predictive modelling be used to identify and reduce inequities in immunization coverage among hard-to-reach and marginalized populations in Ethiopia?

**Why it is Important:**
Despite progress in national immunization rates, significant disparities persist across geographic, socioeconomic, and conflict-affected regions. These gaps leave many children unprotected from preventable diseases, perpetuating cycles of poor health and inequality. Addressing this issue is vital for achieving Universal Health Coverage and the Immunization Agenda 2030 goals. Understanding where and why children remain zero-dose is crucial for designing equitable and data-informed immunization strategies.

**Data and Modelling Approach:**
This question could be addressed using a combination of **geospatial analysis, regression modelling, and machine learning** techniques. Data sources might include demographic and health surveys (DHS), health facility data, remote sensing (for accessibility), and immunization registries. Spatial-temporal models could predict areas of low vaccine uptake, while logistic regression or random forest algorithms could identify predictors of zero-dose status—informing targeted interventions and efficient allocation of immunization resources.

How can climate, mobility, and surveillance data be integrated to model vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue?
Combining climate, mobility, and surveillance data offers a powerful approach to anticipate and control vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. Climate variables (temperature, rainfall, humidity) can predict mosquito breeding patterns, while human mobility data reveal potential transmission pathways. When integrated with disease surveillance and health facility data, these layers can feed into spatio-temporal models that identify emerging hotspots before outbreaks occur. Visualization dashboards can then guide targeted vector control, larval source management, and community education campaigns. By using machine learning or Bayesian models, Ministries of Health can refine risk predictions and allocate resources efficiently. This integrated modelling framework supports early warning systems that connect environmental science with epidemiology, offering a holistic way to reduce the public health burden of vector-borne diseases amid climate variability.","How can predictive modelling be used to strengthen epidemic preparedness and response for vector-borne diseases such as dengue and malaria in Somalia?

1. What is the problem or policy question?

Somalia faces recurrent outbreaks of vector-borne diseases like dengue and malaria, which are often detected late due to weak surveillance systems, limited diagnostic capacity, and fragmented data sources. The key policy question is how predictive modelling can integrate environmental, epidemiological, and mobility data to forecast outbreaks early enough for timely public health action.

2. Why is it important?

Delayed detection and response to vector-borne outbreaks lead to preventable morbidity, mortality, and economic losses. Strengthening early warning systems through data-driven modelling would allow the Ministry of Health to allocate resources efficiently, target high-risk districts, and plan vector control interventions before outbreaks escalate. This is especially critical in Somalia’s fragile health system, where climate variability and urbanization are increasing transmission risks.

3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it?

Key datasets would include DHIS2 surveillance data, meteorological data (rainfall, temperature, humidity), and mobility or population density data.

","1. Immunization Coverage and Zero Dose Children

Policy Question:
How can data-driven modelling help identify zero-dose and under-immunized children to improve equitable immunization coverage in Ethiopia?

Why it is Important:
Many children in Ethiopia still miss life-saving vaccines due to barriers such as poor service accessibility, mobility, and incomplete reporting. Identifying zero-dose children is crucial for designing targeted interventions and achieving universal immunization goals.

Data and Modelling Approach:
Integrating data from health facilities, DHIS2, household surveys, and geospatial sources can support predictive modelling. Machine learning classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forests) can detect risk patterns, while GIS mapping and data visualization tools highlight geographic disparities. This approach would enable the Ministry of Health to focus outreach, mobile clinics, and communication strategies in high-risk areas, improving vaccine equity.
2. Epidemic Forecasting and Preparedness

Policy Question:
How can predictive modelling strengthen epidemic forecasting and preparedness at regional and district levels in Ethiopia?

Why it is Important:
Timely detection and response to outbreaks are essential to minimize disease spread and economic loss. However, data fragmentation and limited forecasting capacity often delay action.

Data and Modelling Approach:
By integrating surveillance data, climate indicators, mobility patterns, and health service reports, time-series and compartmental models (e.g., SEIR) can predict outbreak trends. Interactive dashboards and heat maps can visualize emerging hotspots for regional decision-makers. These models would help allocate resources, guide vaccination campaigns, and strengthen Ethiopia’s epidemic preparedness system.
3. Modelling Vector-Borne Diseases (e.g., Malaria, Dengue)

Policy Question:
How can climate, mobility, and surveillance data be integrated to predict and manage vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue?

Why it is Important:
Vector-borne diseases remain major causes of morbidity in Ethiopia. Climate change, population movement, and ecological shifts increase transmission risk, demanding predictive, data-driven responses.

Data and Modelling Approach:
Integrating climate (temperature, rainfall), human mobility, and entomological surveillance data enables spatial-temporal predictive modelling. Techniques such as Bayesian hierarchical models or machine learning regression can forecast outbreak risk zones. Coupled with geospatial visualization, this approach can guide vector control, resource allocation, and community interventions, enhancing early warning and rapid response capacity.


4. Optimizing Supply Chain Allocation for Public Health Programs

Policy Question:
How can data-driven modelling optimize medical supply chain allocation to improve the availability of essential health commodities?

Why it is Important:
Frequent stockouts of vaccines, medicines, and diagnostic supplies disrupt service delivery and weaken public trust. Optimizing logistics ensures equitable distribution, cost-efficiency, and timely service access.

Data and Modelling Approach:
Using supply chain data (stock levels, transport routes, facility demand), optimization algorithms and simulation models (e.g., linear programming, predictive analytics) can forecast demand and streamline distribution.

Data-driven modeling can enhance immunization coverage by analyzing demographic, geographic, and historical vaccination data to identify patterns and gaps. Predictive models can be employed to anticipate areas with low coverage and target interventions more effectively. Identifying zero-dose children—those who have not received any vaccinations—can be achieved through machine learning algorithms that flag at-risk populations based on various indicators such as socio-economic status, access to healthcare facilities, and historical immunization records. This approach allows health authorities to tailor outreach programs and resources effectively.

Challenge 2: Models and Visualization Tools for the Ministry of Health

To assist the Ministry of Health, various models and visualization tools can be utilized. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) can visually map immunization coverage and identify underserved areas. Dashboards such as Tableau or Power BI can present real-time data analytics, showcasing vaccination trends and coverage statistics in an engaging format. Furthermore, simulation models can help forecast future immunization needs based on current data, allowing for better resource allocation and policy-making.

Challenge 3: Integrating Climate Mobility and Surveillance Data

Integrating climate mobility and surveillance data involves using data fusion techniques to combine information from climate models, population movement patterns, and public health surveillance systems. By analyzing how climate change impacts migration patterns and health outcomes, health authorities can anticipate and respond to potential disease outbreaks. For instance, machine learning algorithms can correlate climate conditions with disease incidence, enabling proactive health interventions in areas experiencing climate-related disruptions.

Challenge 4: Optimizing Supply Chain Models

To optimize supply chain management in immunization programs, an integrated approach using advanced analytics and simulation models can be implemented. Linear programming and optimization algorithms can streamline resource allocation, inventory management, and distribution strategies, ensuring vaccines are delivered efficiently to the right locations. Additionally, real-time data analytics can monitor supply chain performance, allowing for quick adjustments in response to demand fluctuations or logistic challenges, ultimately improving vaccine availability and access.","The problem I wish to explore is the high prevalence of food insecurity in low-income communities and its correlation with poor health outcomes.

1. What is the problem or policy question?
How can a local public health authority (e.g., a city or county health department) effectively leverage existing community resources, such as food banks, schools, and community centers, to improve access to and participation in public health nutrition programs, particularly in underserved neighborhoods?
2. Why is it important?
Despite the availability of federal and state nutrition programs (like SNAP or WIC), barriers such as lack of awareness, transportation issues, and the stigma associated with seeking help often lead to low participation rates and persistent food insecurity and diet-related health issues (e.g., obesity, diabetes) in vulnerable communities. Existing community organizations already possess established trust and reach within these neighborhoods. A policy that strategically integrates and streamlines public health initiatives with these trusted community hubs could significantly enhance program accessibility and effectiveness, leading to better health outcomes and more efficient use of public funds.
3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it?
Data:
Geospatial data: Maps of underserved neighborhoods, locations of existing community partners (food banks, schools, clinics), and public transportation routes to identify physical access gaps.

Drawing from my direct experience with health commodity supply chains for The Global Fund and my Master's in Pharmacoeconomics, I propose a modeling approach that addresses both efficiency and equity.

The core challenge in Ethiopia's diverse landscape is the mismatch between supply and demand, leading to stockouts in some areas and expiries in others. A model must account for more than just population size; it must integrate dynamic variables such as:

Historical Consumption Data: Using facilities' past usage to predict future needs.

Epidemiological Burden: Incorporating disease prevalence data (e.g., malaria cases, HIV positivity rates) to align allocations with actual health demands.

Logistical Constraints: Factoring in road networks, travel times, and storage capacity at the last mile.

Programmatic Targets: Including data on immunization catch-up campaigns or active case-finding initiatives that create demand spikes.

My proposed solution is a two-tiered modeling framework:

A Predictive Model: Using time-series analysis and machine learning in R or Python to forecast commodity needs at the health facility level, based on the integrated variables above.

An Optimization Model: Applying linear programming or a genetic algorithm to these forecasts to generate an optimal, cost-effective allocation plan. This model would be constrained by available budget, vehicle capacity, and cold chain availability, ensuring the solution is practical.

The output would be a dynamic dashboard (built in Power BI or R Shiny) visualizing the recommended allocation plan. It would highlight priority districts, predict potential stockouts, and allow planners to run ""what-if"" scenarios, such as the impact of a new donor shipment or a sudden disease outbreak.

This approach moves beyond static, historical allocation to a responsive, data-driven system. It ensures that life-saving commodities reach the clinics and patients who need them most, directly translating modeling into more resilient and equitable health systems.

","1. What is the problem or policy question?
How can we use geospatial modeling and connectivity data to precisely identify and map clusters of ""zero-dose"" children in Ethiopia, and what is the most cost-effective mix of intervention strategies (e.g., mobile vaccination teams, community health worker intensification, static site expansion) to reach them?

2. Why is it important?
Zero-dose children, who have not received a single routine vaccine, are often the most marginalized and vulnerable. They are key drivers of disease outbreaks and represent a critical equity gap in public health. Reaching them is the first step towards building resilient immunization systems and achieving universal health coverage. Current methods often rely on aggregated data that can mask small, remote clusters of missed children. A precise, granular understanding of where they are and why they are missed is the foundation for effective and efficient policy.

3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it?
We would integrate multiple data sources to move beyond simple coverage estimates:

Routine Immunization Data: From DHIS2, to identify sub-regions with consistently low reported coverage.

Geospatial Data: Satellite imagery on population density, land use, night-time lights, and travel times to the nearest health facility.

Survey Data: Data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) or similar to validate and correct for reporting biases.

Connectivity/Mobility Data: Mobile phone-derived data or transportation network maps to understand population movement and isolation.

Modelling Approach:
A two-phase approach would be developed in R or Python:

Predictive Risk Mapping: Use a machine learning model (like a random forest) to combine the datasets above and predict the probability of a child being zero-dose for every small geographic grid cell. This creates a high-resolution ""risk map"" of zero-dose children.

Resource Optimization Model: Feed this risk map into an optimization algorithm. The model would evaluate the cost, reach, and effectiveness of different intervention strategies to determine the optimal combination to cover the identified clusters, ensuring the maximum number of children are reached within a given budget and logistical constraint.

The output would be a Strategic Deployment Dashboard in Power BI, showing health officials not just where the problems are, but the most efficient way to solve them.

Data-driven models can play a transformative role in strengthening immunization programs by enabling more accurate identification of children who have never received any vaccine. By integrating data from health facilities, community outreach, demographic surveys, and geographic information systems (GIS), predictive models can reveal areas with low vaccination rates, logistical gaps, and vulnerable populations. Machine learning and spatial analysis can help forecast high-risk zones, prioritize resource allocation, and guide targeted interventions. Additionally, real-time dashboards can support health workers and decision-makers in tracking progress and addressing coverage inequalities. Such models not only enhance the efficiency of immunization campaigns but also contribute to equitable health service delivery, ensuring that no child is left behind.","One public health policy question I am interested in exploring during the hackathon is: “How can data-driven models help identify and reduce barriers to full immunization coverage among children in rural Ethiopia?”

This question is important because despite national immunization efforts, many children in remote or marginalized communities remain partially or completely unvaccinated (“zero-dose”), leaving them vulnerable to preventable diseases. Understanding the geographic, socioeconomic, and health system barriers that limit access to vaccination is critical for achieving equitable healthcare coverage and meeting national and global immunization targets.

To address this, I would use a data integration and predictive modelling approach, combining demographic, geographic, and health facility data. Tools such as machine learning classification models, spatial mapping (GIS), and dashboard visualizations could help predict zero-dose areas, guide microplanning, and support evidence-based policymaking for targeted immunization interventions.",Yes,Yes,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZAX6YJqkwdBm6Gap5IYGcvgNV5BP3ZUL

What models or visualization tools can help the Ministry of Health forecast and prepare for epidemic outbreaks at regional or district levels? 
To forecast and prepare for disease outbreaks at regional and district levels, the Ministry of Health can use a mix of predictive models and visualization tools. Mechanistic models, like SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered), simulate how diseases spread. Agent-based models provide insights into how infections move through populations and areas. Machine learning methods, such as random forests, gradient boosting, and recurrent neural networks, can spot early warning signs by examining historical, climate, mobility, and surveillance data.

Visualization is key for turning complex data into clear insights. Interactive dashboards made with R Shiny, Tableau, or Power BI can show real-time case counts, risk maps, and outbreak forecasts at the district level. Geographic Information Systems (GIS), like QGIS and ArcGIS, help map disease hotspots and environmental risks, which directs targeted actions. By combining these methods, health authorities can act quickly, use resources wisely, and share risk information clearly.","1. What is the problem or policy question?
I want to explore how Ethiopia can create a reliable early-warning system for climate-sensitive epidemic outbreaks at regional and district levels. Specifically, I want to know, how can we use integrated climate, mobility, and surveillance data to predict and prevent outbreaks like malaria?
2. Why is it important?
Ethiopia faces repeated outbreaks caused by climate changes, population movement, and a lack of real-time surveillance. Many outbreaks are only identified after transmission increases, which limits timely responses. Developing a data-driven early-warning system would help NDMC and the Ministry of Health identify risks sooner, allocate resources more effectively, and stop epidemics from escalating, ultimately cutting down on unnecessary illness, deaths, and emergency costs.
3. What data and modeling approach might be used to address it?
To tackle this question, the approach would combine:
Data sources
•	Climate data: rainfall, temperature, humidity, NDVI from satellite and reanalysis sources
•	Mobility data: road-network patterns, population movement (e.g., transport hubs)
•	Health surveillance data: DHIS2 weekly case counts, outbreak reports, vector data
Modeling methods
Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet, and LSTM) for predicting outbreak trends
Spatial-temporal models (Bayesian hierarchical modeling) to spot early hotspots
Machine-learning models (Random Forest) to find key predictors and risk thresholds
Visualization tools (ArcGIS) to turn predictions into actionable early-warning maps
This integrated modeling framework would provide timely and practical outbreak risk alerts to improve preparedness and response at local levels.

Public Health Policy Question
How can integrating climate, mobility, and health surveillance data improve early warning and response systems for malaria outbreaks in Ethiopia?

Importance
Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in regions where climate variability and human mobility patterns affect transmission.

Here is a concise, 200-word motivation and interest statement tailored for the EPHI NDMC Public Health Modelling Hackathon, leveraging your CV's strengths.

Motivation and Interest Statement

My professional journey at EPHI and AHRI, leading national surveillance and response during the COVID-19 pandemic, has cemented my belief in data-driven decision-making for epidemic preparedness. I am eager to apply my hands-on experience in molecular epidemiology, genomic sequencing, and managing complex laboratory data systems to the computational challenges of public health modeling.

I am particularly drawn to this hackathon's focus on immunization coverage and zero-dose children. My work in national bacteriology and mycosis reference laboratories involved analyzing gaps in diagnostic networks, a skill directly transferable to identifying and modeling pockets of zero-dose populations. Furthermore, my research on vector-borne diseases like malaria and leishmaniasis provides a foundational understanding of the transmission dynamics you seek to model.

I offer a unique blend of field-level public health insight and technical skills in R, Python, and bioinformatics. I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to a team developing robust models for epidemiological preparedness and health system strengthening. This hackathon represents a critical opportunity to bridge my laboratory and research expertise with advanced computational modeling, ultimately supporting EPHI's mission to safeguard Ethiopia's health.","What I Hope to Contribute:

I hope to contribute a unique, ground-level perspective from my experience in national outbreak response and laboratory leadership at EPHI and AHRI. I can bridge the gap between theoretical models and real-world epidemiological data, ensuring that the models developed are grounded in the practical realities of Ethiopia's health system. My expertise in genomic surveillance of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2 and my skills in data analysis (R, bioinformatics) will allow me to actively help build and validate models, particularly for vector-borne diseases and immunization gaps.

What I Hope to Learn:

I am eager to transition my skills from wet-lab molecular epidemiology to the powerful domain of computational public health. Specifically, I aim to learn and apply advanced modeling techniques to forecast disease spread, optimize intervention strategies, and accurately estimate zero-dose populations. This hackathon is a pivotal opportunity to formalize my coding skills into a structured framework for health system modeling, directly enhancing my ability to support data-driven decision-making at a national level.","Epidemic forecasting and preparedness, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue)","How can climate, mobility, and surveillance data be integrated to model vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue?

How can climate, mobility, and surveillance data be integrated to model vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue?
The Conceptual Framework: The Epidemic Triad, Enhanced
At its core, the model connects the three data types to the fundamental components of disease transmission:
1.	Climate Data (The Vector & Pathogen Enabler):
o	What it represents: The ecological driver. It determines the suitability of the environment for the mosquito vector (Anopheles for malaria, Aedes for dengue).
o	Key Variables:
	Temperature: Accelerates mosquito larval development, the replication of the malaria parasite within the mosquito, and the frequency of mosquito biting. There's a ""Goldilocks zone"" for transmission.
	Rainfall: Creates breeding sites. For malaria, this can mean puddles and pooled water; for dengue, it can fill discarded containers and tires. Both excess and deficit rainfall can be indicative.
	Humidity: Affects adult mosquito survival.
o	Role in the Model: Climate data acts as a leading indicator. It predicts potential for transmission weeks or even months before a surge in human cases is seen in surveillance reports.
2.	Mobility Data (The Human Connector):
o	What it represents: Human movement patterns. This is the critical, often missing, link that explains how the disease spreads geographically.
o	Key Variables: Anonymized and aggregated mobile phone data (call detail records - CDRs) can reveal:
	Commuting Flows: Daily movement from high-risk (e.g., rural, agricultural) to low-risk (urban) areas and back.
	Seasonal Migration: Large-scale movements during holidays or harvest seasons, which can import cases into susceptible populations or export them to new regions.
	Urban Connectivity: Movement between city neighborhoods, which is crucial for dengue transmission in dense urban settings.
o	Role in the Model: Mobility data transforms the model from a static map of risk to a dynamic one. It answers the ""where next?"" question by identifying pathways for epidemic spread.
3.	Surveillance Data (The Ground Truth):
o	What it represents: The historical and real-time record of confirmed and suspected cases from health facilities.
o	Key Variables: Case counts, locations, and dates.
o	Role in the Model: This is the validation anchor. It's the ""what actually happened"" data that we use to train, test, and refine our models. It calibrates the predictions made by the climate and mobility data. However, it is inherently lagging and often incomplete, especially in remote areas, which is precisely why the other data sources are so vital.
A Proposed Integrated Modelling Approach
A powerful way to integrate these streams is through a Machine Learning (ML) pipeline, structured as follows:
1.	Feature Engineering:
o	Create a unified dataset where each row represents a specific district and week.
o	Features (Inputs):
	Climate: Lagged variables (e.g., average temperature 4 weeks ago, total rainfall 8 weeks ago) to account for the delay between environmental conditions and case presentation.
	Mobility: Origin-destination matrices between districts, metrics on population influx/efflux.
	Surveillance (Historical): Lagged case counts from the same and neighboring districts (to capture local transmission dynamics).
	Static Confounders: Population density, land use, known breeding site locations.
o	Target (Output): The number of confirmed cases in the current week.
2.	Model Selection & Training:
o	Ensemble Methods (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting): These are excellent for handling non-linear relationships (e.g., the temperature-transmission curve) and complex interactions between the different data types. They can also rank which features (rainfall vs. mobility) are most important for prediction.
o	Spatio-Temporal Models: Techniques like Bayesian Structured Time Series (BSTS) or graph neural networks can explicitly model the influence of one region's cases on its neighbors, effectively combining the mobility and surveillance data in a principled way.
3.	Output: A Dynamic Risk Map:
o	The model's output isn't just a number; it's a high-resolution, forecasted risk map.
o	It would show not only which districts are at risk now, but which are likely to become high-risk in the next 2-4 weeks.
o	It could also simulate scenarios: ""What would happen to transmission risk if a heatwave hits the northern region while a major religious festival drives mobility from the south?""
Visualization and Public Health Utility
The model's insights must be translated into an intuitive dashboard for health officials:
•	A ""Transmission Potential"" Layer: Driven primarily by climate data, showing areas environmentally ripe for mosquito breeding and parasite development.
•	An ""Importation Risk"" Layer: Driven by mobility data, highlighting districts that are connected to active outbreak zones.
•	A ""Forecasted Outbreak"" Layer: The combined model output, showing the integrated risk and predicted case counts.
•	Resource Allocation Alerts: The system could generate early warnings to pre-position supplies (insecticide-treated nets, rapid diagnostic tests, antimalarials) in forecasted hotspot areas before the cases surge.

Conclusion:
Integrating climate, mobility, and surveillance data allows us to build a ""digital twin"" of the vector-borne disease ecosystem. We move from asking ""Where are the cases?"" to the more powerful questions: ""Where will the cases be, and why?"" This paradigm shift, from surveillance to forecasting, empowers Ministries of Health to transition from reactive insecticide spraying to proactive, targeted interventions, ultimately protecting communities more efficiently and saving lives.

","Problem or Policy Question
""How can we develop an early warning system that uses integrated data streams to predict malaria/dengue outbreaks at the sub-national level, enabling targeted, proactive interventions before epidemics peak?""
The core problem is that current responses to vector-borne diseases are largely reactive - we deploy resources after cases are already surging, missing the critical window for prevention. Health ministries need answers to:
•	""Which districts will experience outbreak spikes in the next 2-4 weeks?""
•	""Where should we pre-position insecticide, bed nets, and diagnostic kits?""
•	""When should we launch public awareness campaigns about mosquito breeding site elimination?""
2. Why It's Important
This integration matters because the traditional surveillance-only approach has fundamental limitations:
•	The Lag Problem: By the time clinical cases appear in health facility data, transmission has been ongoing for weeks. The epidemic train has already left the station.
•	The Complexity of Transmission: These diseases don't spread in simple patterns. They emerge from interactions between:
o	Environmental suitability (climate creating breeding habitats)
o	Human movement (introducing pathogens to new areas)
o	Local immunity levels (surveillance history indicating susceptible populations)
The impact of solving this would be transformative:
•	Resource Optimization: Limited public health budgets could be targeted to where they're needed most, when they're needed most
•	Outbreak Prevention: Moving from containing outbreaks to preventing them entirely
•	Lives Saved: Reducing the ~400,000 annual malaria deaths and the growing dengue burden
•	Health System Resilience: Reducing the crisis-mode burden on clinics and hospitals
3. Data and Modelling Approach
Data Requirements
Climate Data:
•	Satellite-derived: Land surface temperature, precipitation, vegetation indices (NDVI), soil moisture
•	Temporal resolution: Daily or weekly aggregates
•	Key advantage: Provides leading indicators - environmental conditions suitable for mosquito breeding appear weeks before human cases
Mobility Data:
•	Anonymized mobile phone data: Origin-destination matrices between districts
•	Alternative proxies: Night-time lights, social media check-ins, transportation data
•	Purpose: Models how infected individuals might seed new outbreaks in susceptible areas
Surveillance Data:
•	Historical case data: District-level malaria/dengue cases over multiple years
•	Real-time reporting: Current weekly case reports from health facilities
•	Role: Ground truth for model training and validation
Proposed Modelling Approach
I'm particularly interested in a two-stage ensemble model:
Stage 1: Environmental Suitability Scoring
•	Use climate data to create a weekly ""vector breeding potential"" index for each district
•	Machine learning (Random Forest/XGBoost) trained on historical climate-case relationships
•	Output: Probability of outbreak if pathogens are introduced
Stage 2: Integrated Risk Forecasting
•	Combine environmental suitability with mobility patterns and recent case reports
•	Use spatio-temporal models that account for neighborhood effects
•	Output: Weekly outbreak probability forecasts for each district, 2-4 weeks ahead

Key Innovation Focus
What excites me most is the potential to build an interpretable AI tool that doesn't just predict but explains:
•	""District X has high outbreak risk because of recent rainfall + population influx from outbreak area Y + low local immunity""
•	This transparency is crucial for building trust with public health decision-makers
The hackathon would be the perfect opportunity to prototype this integration and demonstrate how these disparate data streams can create something greater than the sum of their parts - a genuine crystal ball for public health planning.

","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Epidemic forecasting and preparedness, Health systems optimization and resource allocation","Effective epidemic forecasting is essential for Ethiopia’s health system, particularly given recurring outbreaks and regional variability in disease transmission. Data-driven modelling can equip the Ministry of Health with timely, actionable insights by predicting when and where outbreaks are likely to occur. By integrating routine surveillance data, climate indicators, mobility patterns, and health service utilization, predictive models such as time-series analysis, SEIR models, and machine-learning–based forecasting can identify early signals of emerging epidemics at regional and district levels.
Visualization tools, like interactive dashboards, GIS-based heat maps, and trend projection charts can further support decision-makers by translating complex analytics into intuitive, real-time insights. These tools can guide resource allocation, strengthen early warning systems, and support rapid response planning. Strengthening localized forecasting capacity will enhance Ethiopia’s preparedness and enable proactive, evidence-based responses to outbreaks, ultimately reducing morbidity and mortality.
","1.	Policy Question: How can Ethiopia better forecast district-level outbreaks of communicable diseases—such as cholera, measles, or malaria—to guide timely resource allocation and strengthen early warning systems?
2.	Why It Is Important? Ethiopia experiences recurrent outbreaks that strain already limited health resources. Delays in detecting and responding to these events contribute to preventable morbidity and mortality. District-level forecasting is crucial because transmission patterns vary widely by geography, climate, mobility, and health service access. Strengthening predictive capacity can help the Ministry of Health allocate supplies, deploy rapid response teams, and enhance preparedness before outbreaks escalate.
3.	Data and Modelling Approach: This question can be addressed using an integrated dataset combining surveillance reports, climate variables, population density, mobility flows, and historical outbreak trends. Time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet), SEIR compartmental models, and machine-learning algorithms (random forests, LSTM neural networks) can be applied to detect patterns and generate localized forecasts. Outputs can be translated into GIS dashboards and early-warning alerts to inform policy decisions.

EPHIA Project: As an interviewer, I was deeply involved in collecting and validating complex population-based health data, which is the foundation of any modeling effort.

KNCV TB Foundation: My role as a Research Nurse involved the strict application of clinical protocols and real-time data management for a BMGF-funded clinical trial, demanding high accuracy and meticulous data validation.

HDAMA & CHAI: In my roles as Technical Advisor and Health Security Activity Officer, I routinely utilized health data for performance monitoring and strategic planning, driving data-driven decisions under pressure.","My interest stems from a decade of field experience that underscores the critical need for data-driven decision-making in Ethiopian public health. Having worked as a research nurse, a technical advisor for CHAI, and a field data collector for major surveys like EPHIA, I have generated and managed foundational data, but I now seek to engage in the analytical and modeling stage.

This hackathon offers a unique opportunity to directly apply my granular understanding of data quality and programmatic context to high-level challenges. I am particularly drawn to the collaborative, rapid development structure, which mirrors real-world emergency public health responses. I want to shift my focus from data generation to solution development, collaborating with modellers and software developers to translate complex public health data into actionable, evidence-based tools for EPHI and the Ministry of Health.","Contribution: I will contribute strong expertise in data integrity and validation, ensuring models are grounded in accurate, contextually verified information. My experience conducting facility and community assessments (e.g., during my TPM role and with Project HOPE) provides critical insight into the logistical and behavioral factors that influence model inputs and field implementation. I can bridge the gap between abstract models and real-world public health delivery.

Learning: I hope to significantly enhance my skills in predictive public health modeling, specifically utilizing large datasets to forecast trends in priority diseases. I also aim to gain proficiency in new data visualization and rapid prototyping tools used by data scientists to make complex analyses immediately accessible to non-technical program managers, thereby accelerating the transition from data to policy.","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Epidemic forecasting and preparedness, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue), Health systems optimization and resource allocation","3. How can climate, mobility, and surveillance data be integrated to model vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue?

This challenge area is critically relevant to Ethiopia's public health goals, particularly as malaria elimination efforts are threatened by population movement and climate change. My current work in regional health security and community-based surveillance has repeatedly shown that the influx of seasonal mobile workers due to development corridors—an explicit observation from my field reports—creates rapidly shifting, high-risk micro-geographies that routine surveillance systems often miss.

The solution requires developing a dynamic risk-mapping tool. This tool would integrate:

Routine Surveillance Data (DHIS2/HMIS): Case confirmation and incidence trends.

Climate Data: Satellite-derived rainfall, temperature, and vegetation indices (NDVI) to predict vector habitats.

Mobility Data: Anonymized cell phone data or road network analysis (using GIS/ArcGIS) to predict population influx into agricultural or construction areas.

By creating a predictive model that weighs these three variables, we can transition from reactive reporting to proactive resource allocation. This allows the Ministry of Health to target intervention strategies, such as pre-positioning RDTs and ACTs (drawing on my supply chain audit experience) and deploying mobile diagnostic teams to high-risk zones before case spikes turn into outbreaks. This is an essential step for reaching mobile, zero-access populations and sustaining elimination progress.","Public Health Policy Question: Optimizing Disease Interventions in Development Corridors
1. What is the problem or policy question?
The core policy question is: How can the Ministry of Health (MoH) and implementing partners optimally allocate mobile diagnostic and intervention resources (RDTs, ACTs, vaccines, health education) to transient, high-risk populations (seasonal mobile workers, construction workers) that move along Ethiopia’s active development corridors?

The current system relies heavily on fixed health facility reporting and periodic outreach. However, the transient nature of these populations—which are often disproportionately affected by malaria, cholera, and other infectious diseases—leads to underreporting, delayed response, and resource wastage in fixed sites where the target group is only present temporarily.

2. Why is it important?
This problem is critical for both disease control and health equity:

Epidemic Preparedness: As noted in the Amibara report, the influx of mobile workers creates an ""emerging public health risk"" that increases the vulnerability to outbreaks (malaria, cholera). If the MoH cannot accurately track and intervene with these groups, they act as silent reservoirs or vectors, undermining national disease elimination and control efforts, and posing a security risk to settled communities.

Programmatic Efficiency: My experience as a Third-Party Monitor (TPM) taught me that resource allocation must be efficient. Deploying an expensive, fully-equipped mobile team to a location that was cleared a week ago is a waste. The MoH needs a model to predict the location and density of these populations in near real-time to ensure resources are delivered to the right place at the right time.

3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it?
Component	Data Source	Modelling Approach
Problem Definition / Location	Construction project schedules, road networks, temporary shelter data (GIS mapping of major construction sites and worker camps).	Geospatial Hotspot Analysis: Use GIS tools to map historical movement patterns and define high-risk routes and concentration points along the corridors.
Population Dynamics / Movement	Anonymized Mobility Data (e.g., aggregated cellphone tower data showing movement from source regions to corridor hubs), or proxy data like temporary camp permits.	Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) / Network Analysis: Create an ABM to simulate how disease spreads through a highly mobile population network, allowing us to predict where the next group of infected individuals will cluster.
Resource Optimization	Historical supply chain data (stock levels, utilization), field reports (like the Amibara data).	Optimization Algorithms (Linear Programming): Build a model that takes the output of the ABM (predicted population location) and combines it with available resources (mobile team capacity, RDT stock) to generate the optimal daily deployment schedule that maximizes coverage for the transient population while minimizing travel cost and time.

By integrating case data, mobility patterns, climate indicators, and health service utilization, these models can highlight high-risk districts and estimate the trajectory of an emerging threat.

Clear visualization is equally critical. Tools such as dynamic heat maps, trend dashboards, and risk-scoring visual layers can help decision-makers quickly interpret complex patterns and prioritize interventions. For example, a district-level dashboard showing projected case counts alongside resource gaps enables rapid deployment of supplies, staff, and response teams.

By combining predictive modelling with intuitive visualization, I aim to help design solutions that reduce response time, guide proactive resource allocation, and ultimately minimize the impact of epidemics on communities.","Public Health Policy Question: What national guidelines are needed to standardize data-sharing across regions to support real-time public health modelling?

1. What is the problem or policy question?
The question is how Ethiopia can establish national data-sharing guidelines that allow regions, districts, and health institutions to exchange timely, complete, and standardized data. Clear guidelines are essential for enabling real-time modelling that informs rapid decisions during outbreaks and other public health emergencies.

2. Why is it important?
Fragmented data systems limit the country’s ability to detect threats early, forecast trends, and coordinate response across regions. Without standardized formats, timelines, and responsibilities, the Ministry of Health cannot fully rely on modelling outputs for national planning. Strong data-sharing guidelines would ensure consistency, improve data quality, and support a unified system capable of guiding preparedness, resource allocation, and emergency response.

3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it?
This policy question can be supported by assessing existing surveillance, mobility, climate, and health service data streams. Modelling approaches, such as real-time forecasting models, and anomaly detection systems, can demonstrate how standardized, timely data improves predictive accuracy and operational decision-making.

Effective modelling of these diseases requires an understanding of how environmental conditions, human movement patterns, and real-time surveillance signals interact to shape transmission dynamics. Climate variables including temperature, rainfall, and humidity directly influence vector breeding cycles and parasite development. When combined with mobility data, these factors help illuminate how populations move across ecological zones and potentially transport infections into new areas. Surveillance data then provides the epidemiological grounding needed to validate and refine model predictions.

Integrating these datasets enables the development of predictive models capable of identifying emerging hotspots, guiding targeted interventions, and optimizing resource allocation. Such models also support early warning systems that can enhance preparedness and improve the timeliness of vector control measures. In the Ethiopian context, this integrated approach holds significant promise for reducing disease burden and strengthening health-system resilience.","1. Problem or policy question
I am particularly interested in exploring how predictive modelling can support the early identification of districts at elevated risk for malaria resurgence following seasonal fluctuations or disruptions in control measures. The core policy question is: How can integrated climate, entomological, and routine surveillance data be used to anticipate localized malaria rebounds and guide timely, targeted interventions?

2. Importance
Malaria remains a major public health challenge in Ethiopia, with transmission patterns that vary widely across ecological zones. Periods of declining incidence often lead to reduced vigilance and resource reallocation, increasing the likelihood of resurgence. Early detection of rebound risk is essential to prevent outbreaks, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure efficient use of limited public health resources.

3. Data and modelling approach
Addressing this question would require combining climate indicators (rainfall, temperature, humidity), vector surveillance data, population mobility patterns, and routine health-facility case reports.

I hope to contribute strong analytical thinking, practical modelling skills, and a collaborative mindset to help my team build solutions that address real public health challenges. I am ready to support data cleaning, exploratory analysis, model development, and visualization to ensure the final outputs are both technically sound and useful for decision-makers.

I also hope to learn from experts at NDMC, EPHI, and partner institutions—especially in areas of advanced modelling, health systems analytics, and translating data insights into policy recommendations. Working alongside diverse professionals will expose me to new tools, methodologies, and ways of approaching complex health problems.

Overall, I want to contribute meaningful technical input while gaining deeper experience in public health modelling and strengthening my ability to design solutions that have real-world impact in Ethiopia.",Epidemic forecasting and preparedness,"Data-driven modelling can significantly improve immunization coverage by identifying geographic, social, and logistical factors that contribute to zero-dose children. Predictive models can map high-risk districts, estimate missed communities, and detect patterns linked to mobility, poverty, or facility access. Combining routine data, survey results, and geospatial layers enables targeted micro-planning. These insights help health workers prioritize specific kebeles, plan outreach sessions, and allocate resources more efficiently. Ultimately, modelling can support the Ministry of Health in designing interventions that ensure every child receives essential vaccines.","1. Problem/Question:
How can Ethiopia identify and prioritize zero-dose communities to improve equitable immunization coverage?

2. Why it matters:
Zero-dose children are the most vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases. Identifying and targeting these communities supports national immunization goals, strengthens primary healthcare, and reduces outbreaks of measles, polio, and other diseases.

3. Data & modelling approach:
I would use routine immunization data, demographic surveys, geospatial datasets, mobility patterns, and health facility accessibility metrics. A combination of machine learning classification models, spatial clustering, and geospatial risk mapping can highlight high-risk clusters. A decision-support dashboard would allow the Ministry of Health to prioritize interventions effectively.",No,No,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1riu6I4hG_5HqTGij2-nzE_xlhKxl38QN

In my work, I see how important good data and modelling are for planning, prevention, and better decision-making.

This event will help me learn new skills, work with other people, and get more experience in analysing health data. I want to improve the way I understand and use data so I can support better public health programs in the future.

I believe this hackathon is a good chance for me to learn, share ideas, and help create useful solutions for real public health challenges.
","I hope to contribute my experience from working in public health at the community level. I can share ideas about the challenges in data collection, service delivery, and how modelling can support better planning and response.

I also want to learn new skills in data analysis, forecasting, and public health modelling. I want to understand how to turn raw data into useful information that helps decision-makers.

This event is a good chance for me to learn from experts, work with a team, and improve how I use data in my daily work.","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Epidemic forecasting and preparedness, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue)","Datable modelling can help a lot to improve immunization in Ethiopia, especially to find zero-dose children. Many children are missed because we do not always have clear and updated information about where they live or why they are not reached. By using data from health facilities, population numbers, movement of people, and community situations, models can show the places where the risk of zero-dose children is high.
Simple maps and hotspot tools can guide health workers to focus on hard-to-reach areas, mobile communities, and places affected by conflict. Machine-learning models can also help predict where new zero-dose cases may appear in the future.
With these tools, the Ministry of Health and partners can plan better outreach, use resources wisely, and work to reduce the number of missed children in different regions.","1. What is the problem or policy question?
I want to look at the problem of zero-dose children. My question is: How can we use data and simple models to find the places where many children are not getting any vaccines?
2. Why is it important?
This is important because zero-dose children have higher risk for sickness and outbreaks. In Ethiopia, many children are missed because they live far, they move from place to place, or health services are not regular. If we do not know where these children are, it is hard to plan outreach and give the right support.
3. What data and modelling can be used?
We can use health facility reports, population data, mobility data, and local situation data. Simple mapping tools, hotspot maps, and basic machine-learning models can help show high-risk places. This can help the Ministry of Health plan better and reach the missed children.

My strong academic foundation, including a Master of Science in Biostatistics, has provided me with a solid understanding of quantitative research methods and advanced statistical software like R, Stata, and SPSS. This is directly relevant to the hackathon’s focus on modelling and analytics.
I have practical experience analyzing large, national-level health datasets, such as DHS and PMA data, which requires interpreting complex information and producing detailed reports. The opportunity to apply these skills in the hackathon's focus areas, like epidemic forecasting or immunization coverage, would allow me to collaborate directly with public health decision-makers and co-create practical, policy-relevant solutions. This hackathon is an exceptional chance to bridge the gap between my modelling expertise and real-world policy outcomes for the betterment of public health in Ethiopia.","I hope to make a significant contribution to the hackathon by leveraging my experience in Biostatistics and handling national-level big data like DHS and PMA. Specifically, I can contribute by:
Developing robust models: Applying advanced statistical methods, particularly multilevel regression analysis (as noted in my under-review abstract ) and my proficiency in R, STATA, and SAS , to create accurate models for the focus areas, such as epidemic forecasting or zero-dose estimation.
Actionable Data Analysis: Utilizing my skills in data extraction, analysis, and reporting to translate complex model outputs into clear, policy-relevant insights for public health decision-makers.
I aim to learn by collaborating with experts to enhance my practical skills in applying public health modelling directly to urgent policy questions. This event is a valuable opportunity to deepen my understanding of current health systems optimization strategies in Ethiopia.",Health systems optimization and resource allocation,"I choose to reflect on the challenge area: How can data-driven modelling improve immunization coverage and identify zero-dose children in Ethiopia?

My expertise in Biostatistics and experience with national-level datasets (like DHS, which often contains immunization records ) makes this a compelling and highly relevant area. Data-driven modelling offers a powerful way to move beyond simple coverage reporting to targeted, effective interventions.
1. Modelling Approaches for Improvement
Data-driven modelling can improve immunization coverage and identify zero-dose children through several key statistical and machine learning approaches:


Geospatial Risk Mapping (Clustering and Hotspots): I can utilize the Geographic Information System (Arc GIS) skills I possess  to spatially model where zero-dose children are concentrated. By analyzing geographic coordinates from national surveys like DHS and overlaying them with demographic and facility data, we can use spatial regression models (e.g., using R or STATA ) to:


Identify high-risk ""hotspots"" where coverage is consistently low.

Determine the key environmental or accessibility factors (distance to health facilities, terrain) contributing to these clusters. This helps the Ministry of Health (MoH) target resources precisely.


Predictive Risk Factor Modelling: Using my experience with multilevel regression analysis, we can build models that predict the probability of a child being zero-dose based on household and maternal characteristics. Variables I'm familiar with from analyzing large datasets  include:


Maternal education and wealth status.

Media exposure and access to health information.

Household size and urban/rural residence.

This prediction helps prioritize outreach efforts to specific demographic groups.

2. Identifying Zero-Dose Children

Big Data Integration and Index Generation: My background in managing and extracting indicators from big national-level data  is crucial here. We can integrate and harmonize data from multiple sources (DHS, PMA, health facility records, census projections) to create a comprehensive Immunization Deficit Index. This index would be a stronger measure than reliance on a single survey, allowing for real-time monitoring and a more accurate enumeration of zero-dose children at granular administrative levels.


Data Visualization and Dashboarding: To make the modelling results actionable for the MoH, I would use my software skills (e.g., Microsoft Excel and Power Point ) combined with mapping tools (Arc GIS ) to create interactive dashboards. These dashboards would instantly show MoH decision-makers:


The location of zero-dose hotspots .

The primary demographic drivers in those areas.

The projected number of children missed if current trends continue.

The hackathon is the ideal setting to translate these statistical and data management skills into a tangible tool that strengthens Ethiopia's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI).","I am personally interested in exploring the challenge area: What modelling approaches can optimize supply chain allocation for public health programs? This aligns with the ""Health Systems Optimization"" focus of the hackathon.

1. The Problem or Policy Question
The core policy question I am interested in is: How can we use predictive modelling to dynamically allocate essential public health commodities (like vaccines, essential medicines, or diagnostic kits) across Ethiopian districts to minimize stock-outs and wastage, especially given fluctuating demand and logistical challenges?

Currently, supply chain allocation can be rigid or based on historical averages, which often fails to account for sudden changes in disease burden (e.g., an unexpected localized outbreak) or seasonal shifts in health service utilization. This leads to preventable stock-outs in high-need areas and potential wastage in low-demand areas.

2. Why It Is Important
Optimizing the public health supply chain is critically important for several reasons:

Saving Lives and Improving Health Outcomes: Stock-outs of vaccines or essential medicines directly translate to treatment failure, disease spread, and preventable deaths, particularly in remote areas. Optimized allocation ensures commodities are available where and when they are needed most.

Maximizing Resource Efficiency: Ethiopia's public health system operates with finite resources. Minimizing wastage of time-sensitive or costly commodities (like specific vaccines) and reducing the logistical costs associated with emergency resupply leads to a more efficient health system. My background in data analysis and critical thinking is essential for this problem-solving.

Strengthening Health Systems: A responsive and reliable supply chain is a foundational pillar of a resilient health system. Successfully addressing this policy question contributes to the overall stability and effectiveness of public health interventions.

3. Data and Modelling Approach
To address this policy question, I propose a Predictive Geospatial Demand Model using my combined skills in statistics, data management, and geographic information systems.




Required Data Sources:

Consumption Data: Historical stock-out and consumption rates from the Electronic Logistics Management Information System (e-LMIS) or similar facility-level reports.

Disease Surveillance Data: Real-time or recent case reports (e.g., for vaccine-preventable diseases) from the national surveillance system.


Socio-Demographic and Geographic Data: Population density, distance to major distribution hubs, road network data (using Arc GIS for spatial analysis), and socioeconomic indicators (which influence health-seeking behavior) from sources like DHS.


Modelling Approach:


Time Series Forecasting: Apply ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing models (using R or STATA) to baseline historical demand for a commodity in each district.


Predictive Regression: Integrate the time-series forecast with multilevel regression analysis (a skill I possess ) that includes key covariates like recent disease trends, population movement (mobility data, if available), and seasonal factors (e.g., rainy season impacts on transport).


Optimization Layer: Use the predicted demand to feed into a linear programming or optimization algorithm that determines the optimal quantity to ship to each facility, minimizing both predicted stock-outs and overstocking, given current warehouse inventory and logistical constraints.

This approach would result in a dynamic allocation tool that makes real-time, data-driven supply decisions.",Yes,No,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w2VG6IyYaLXbi2tggVNPv07TsexSUAqe

","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Epidemic forecasting and preparedness","To improving immunization coverage in Ethiopia and identifying zero-dose children—those who have not received their first dose of Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis (DTP1) vaccine—can be significantly addressed through data-driven modelling. this can be achieved by integrating and analyzing varies source datasets, such as District Health Information Software (DHIS2) vaccination records, geographic information systems (GIS) data mapping population density and settlement patterns, and mobility data showing population movement, a predictive model can be created. This model would use factors like distance to health facilities, conflict-related displacement, and micro-level coverage gaps to generate high-resolution risk maps. These maps would pinpoint specific villages, Kebeles, or even households where zero-dose children are most likely concentrated, allowing us to move beyond aggregate regional statistics and implement highly targeted, resource-efficient outreach strategies like mobile vaccination clinics or community health worker deployment, ultimately increasing coverage and achieving greater health equity. hence varies data sources can be Triangulated, and also critically evaluated by different models (e.g. Coincidence Analysis etc.). ","1. What is the Problem or Policy Question?

The public health policy question is: What is the most cost-effective and equitable strategy for transitioning from reactive, epidemic-focused vaccination campaigns to the routine inclusion of multivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccines (MCV) in Ethiopia's Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)?

2. Why is it Important?

The transition to routine, multivalent immunization is critically important for several reasons:

Epidemiological Shift: Relying solely on the MenA vaccine leaves the population vulnerable to the increasing prevalence of serogroups W, X, and C, risking large-scale, catastrophic epidemics.

Sustained Protection: Routine EPI inclusion offers long-term, sustained population immunity, moving beyond the high cost, logistics, and unavoidable mortality associated with reactive, emergency outbreak responses.

Equity and Access: The introduction must address existing disparities in vaccine access. The strategy must explicitly prioritize high-risk, underserved zero-dose children in regions like Afar and Somali, thereby addressing the crucial public health issue of equity.

3. What Data and Modelling Approach Might Be Used to Address It?

Exploring this question requires a data-driven model to directly inform decision-makers. 
The primary approach will be a Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA):

Modelling Approach:
The CEA will compare various introduction strategies to determine which one maximizes public health benefit per dollar spent. These strategies will include:

Routine infant vaccination only.

Routine infant vaccination coupled with a large, one-time catch-up campaign for older adolescents and young adults (a high-transmission group).

Maintaining the current reactive policy while building capacity (baseline scenario).

Data Utilized:

Available cost-of-illness data for W, X, and C serogroup outbreaks.

Projected vaccine procurement and delivery costs (e.g., cold chain infrastructure, personnel).

Demographic data, including population size and birth cohorts.

Disease burden metrics (e.g., historical incidence, case fatality rates).

Primary Policy Output:
The model's output will be a recommendation on the optimal strategy that maximizes Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted per dollar spent. Crucially, the analysis will also include an equity metric, ensuring the recommended strategy prioritizes health benefits in high-risk and underserved communities.",Yes,No,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rcp9Qy0bZ0gb9ZIyfxoPAmf004xGyxxC

","How can we predict and prevent upcoming measles outbreak? 

Ethiopia is one of a high-burden country where measles remains a significant public health challenge contributing to recurrent outbreaks due to low vaccination coverage, high population mobility, and limited healthcare access in certain regions. 

Early outbreak detection and response are hindered by fragmented surveillance systems, which often lack interoperability and data accessibility. In Ethiopia, measles surveillance data flow from the community to higher administrative levels, but emergency preparedness and response plans are primarily available at the district level.

With over 10 years of experience in research, data analysis, and academic instruction, combined with advanced training in computational data science, I am deeply passionate about applying analytical methods to solve real-world health challenges in Ethiopia.

This hackathon provides a unique opportunity to collaborate with interdisciplinary teams and contribute to modelling solutions that can strengthen epidemic preparedness, improve immunization strategies, and support health system optimization. I am particularly drawn to the event’s emphasis on practical, data-driven approaches and direct engagement with public health decision-makers, as this bridges the gap between research, policy, and implementation.

Participating in this program will not only deepen my modelling and computational skills but also allow me to contribute meaningfully to Ethiopia’s health policy priorities. I see this hackathon as a valuable platform to innovate, learn, and create impactful solutions that can improve health outcomes and resilience across the country.","I hope to contribute my strong background in data science, statistical modeling, and digital data management to support the development of robust, actionable models for epidemic forecasting, immunization coverage estimation, and health systems analysis. My experience using Python, R, SQL, and machine learning combined with more than a decade of research expertise—positions me to add value to a collaborative, fast-paced modelling environment.

From this event, I aim to deepen my practical skills in public health modelling, improve my understanding of disease transmission dynamics, and learn new tools and frameworks used by leading experts and institutions. I also look forward to engaging with mentors, sharing ideas with peers, and gaining insights into how modelling outputs are translated into policy decisions. Ultimately, I hope to emerge better equipped to support data-driven public health interventions in Ethiopia.","Epidemic forecasting and preparedness, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue)","I have chosen to address the second question.
Forecasting epidemic outbreaks at regional or district levels requires models that combine surveillance data, climate indicators, mobility patterns, and historical case trends. Approaches such as SEIR compartmental models, machine learning–based early warning systems, and hybrid mechanistic-statistical models can help detect anomalies and predict outbreak trajectories. Time-series methods like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM networks can anticipate increases in reported cases, while stochastic simulations can explore multiple outbreak scenarios. For decision-makers, user-friendly visualization tools such as interactive dashboards, heat maps, risk scoring systems, and trend forecasts are essential for timely action. When these models are integrated with real-time reporting systems and displayed through platforms like Power BI, DHIS2 dashboards, or GIS tools, the Ministry of Health can better anticipate surges, pre-position resources, and strengthen epidemic preparedness.","1. Problem / Policy Question
How can we identify communities in Ethiopia with high numbers of zero-dose or under-immunized children to improve targeted immunization efforts?

2. Why It Is Important
Zero-dose children are at highest risk of vaccine-preventable diseases. Understanding where they live helps the Ministry of Health plan outreach activities, allocate resources, and prevent outbreaks. Improving immunization equity is essential for reducing child mortality and strengthening primary healthcare.

3. Data and Modelling Approach
This problem can be addressed by combining DHS data, routine immunization records, geospatial accessibility data, and population information. Spatial analysis and machine learning models can be used to predict zero-dose risk and highlight underserved areas. The results can be shown through simple GIS maps or dashboards to support targeted decision-making.",Yes,No,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1465DQCzAiBoU7SsPo3IITmPVXAMaMPGY

I tried to demonstrate the expansion of Lake Turkana towards the Ethiopian land in the last 3 consecutive years and its overall impacts on the community living in the South Omo region using the Digital Earth Africa Sandbox datacube and python coding experiences.","I am driven to participate in this hackathon to bridge my expertise in geospatial data science with tangible public health challenges in Ethiopia. My background involves using Python and satellite data for environmental monitoring, and I am eager to apply these skills specifically to vector-borne disease modelling. The opportunity to work directly with national health leaders at EPHI is a unique chance to ensure my technical work is grounded in real-world policy needs.

This hands-on experience is a direct complement to my academic goal of pursuing a PhD in climate-health modeling, specifically for malaria. Tackling a focused problem in a collaborative, interdisciplinary setting will sharpen my practical modelling skills and deepen my understanding of the Ethiopian health context. I am particularly excited by the prospect of co-creating a solution that could directly inform decision-making and ultimately contribute to strengthening our national public health system.","I hope to contribute my strong skills in Python, geospatial analysis, and machine learning to help build a robust model, particularly for vector-borne diseases. I will bring my experience in integrating satellite data with ground observations to enhance the model's predictive power.

For my own learning, I am eager to gain hands-on experience in translating theoretical models into practical, policy-ready tools. I specifically want to learn the nuances of integrating diverse public health datasets and the collaborative process of co-creating solutions with domain experts and decision-makers.

How can climate, mobility, and surveillance data be integrated to model vector-borne diseases like malaria or dengue?

Integrating climate, mobility, and surveillance data enables a holistic view of vector-borne disease dynamics. Climate data (e.g., temperature, rainfall) defines environmental suitability for vectors by shaping breeding habitats and parasite development rates. Mobility data—derived from mobile networks or travel surveys—captures human movement patterns that drive pathogen spread across regions. When combined with real-time surveillance data (case reports, vector counts), these layers reveal how climate-driven transmission hotspots interact with population flows to ignite or sustain outbreaks. For example, satellite-derived rainfall anomalies can flag emerging breeding sites, while mobility networks identify high-risk routes for case importation, together creating a spatiotemporal map of transmission risk.

The technical integration occurs through coupled modeling frameworks. Climate and mobility inputs can fuel mechanistic models (e.g., agent-based simulations) where humans move through dynamic climate-defined risk landscapes. Alternatively, machine learning approaches—like spatiotemporal Bayesian models or LSTMs—fuse these datasets to predict outbreak trajectories, quantify intervention impacts, and generate early warnings. This synthesis allows policymakers to simulate scenarios: for instance, how a drought-induced migration might alter malaria burden in a receptive region. By bridging environmental drivers, human behavior, and health system data, we shift from static risk mapping to adaptive, targeted control strategies that save lives.","3. What data and modelling approach might be used to address it?

To address this, a multi-source data framework is essential. Key data includes: climate variables (temperature, rainfall from satellites like Sentinel and MODIS), human mobility data (anonymized mobile phone records, travel surveys), and surveillance data (historical case counts, vector abundance from health facilities). These datasets must be harmonized into a common spatiotemporal scale (e.g., weekly, district-level) using geospatial platforms like Google Earth Engine.

For modelling, a hybrid approach is most powerful. A mechanistic model (like an agent-based simulation) can use the mobility data to simulate human movement and climate data to define dynamic transmission zones. This can be integrated with a statistical or machine learning model (e.g., a Bayesian spatiotemporal model or an LSTM neural network) that learns from the surveillance data to refine predictions and quantify the influence of each driver. This fusion allows for forecasting outbreaks and testing the impact of targeted interventions in specific climate and mobility contexts.",Yes,No,Yes,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XOdv4vpGHYFyGFJgdBnmmE-dzpnJ8dXx

I also look forward to gaining insights into how digital tools and AI can be used to address complex public health challenges.","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue)","1.Data-driven modelling can significantly enhance immunization programs by identifying geographic and demographic pockets of zero-dose children. By combining geospatial data, demographic surveys, and health facility reports, predictive models can highlight underserved communities and forecast future coverage gaps. These insights allow targeted outreach, better micro-planning, and efficient deployment of health workers and vaccines. Ultimately, modelling helps the Ministry of Health focus resources where they are most needed, ensuring that no child is missed.
2.Advanced modelling techniques such as Bayesian geostatistical modelling, machine-learning classification, and spatiotemporal risk prediction can greatly improve Ethiopia’s ability to identify zero-dose children. Integrating datasets from DHS, HMIS, geospatial layers, conflict/displacement data, and satellite-derived accessibility measures enables high-resolution mapping of immunization gaps. Models can generate probability surfaces indicating where zero-dose clusters exist and predict which districts are at highest risk of future decline. These outputs can support micro-planning, optimize cold-chain distribution, and guide deployment of mobile vaccination teams. Such data-driven systems help the Ministry of Health allocate resources efficiently and accelerate progress toward equitable immunization.
3.Epidemic forecasting for regional and district levels can be strengthened using time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet), SEIR-based compartmental models, and machine-learning algorithms that incorporate climate data, mobility patterns, and surveillance indicators. Early-warning dashboards combining real-time HMIS data, remote-sensing climate variables, and historical outbreak trends can help the Ministry of Health anticipate hotspots weeks in advance. Such modelling enhances preparedness, resource allocation, and rapid response.
4.Vector-borne disease prediction requires merging entomological data with climate variables (rainfall, temperature), human mobility flows, and environmental risk layers. Using geospatial modelling, satellite-derived climate analytics, and agent-based simulations, it is possible to predict malaria or dengue transmission intensity at fine geographic scales. This integrated system can help identify high-risk seasons, track potential spread, and support targeted vector-control operations.
5.Supply-chain optimization can be achieved through linear programming, network flow algorithms, and simulation-based modelling. By integrating logistics data, stock levels, facility demand, transportation routes, and cold-chain capacity, models can recommend optimal distribution schedules and minimize bottlenecks. These tools help ensure timely delivery of vaccines, medicines, and nutrition commodities, reducing stockouts and improving service coverage.
","1.How can Ethiopia use integrated data-driven modelling to identify zero-dose and under-immunized children in hard-to-reach, pastoralist, and conflict-affected areas to improve equitable immunization coverage?
2.Zero-dose children remain concentrated in specific regions such as Afar, Somali, Benishangul-Gumuz, and conflict-affected districts in Amhara and Oromia. These children are at the highest risk of vaccine-preventable diseases, malnutrition, and mortality. Persistent inequities in immunization coverage also hinder Ethiopia’s progress toward national and global targets, including IA2030. A clear, data-driven model could guide micro-planning, outreach prioritization, cold-chain deployment, and health worker allocation, ensuring no community is left behind.
3.The model would integrate HMIS data, Woreda-level EPI coverage reports, DHS and EMDHS datasets, geospatial accessibility data, conflict/mobility layers, population distribution (WorldPop), and satellite-derived environmental indicators.

Data-driven modelling can play a transformative role by integrating multiple data sources, such as household surveys, health facility records, demographic surveillance data, and geospatial data.

Spatial and predictive models can identify high-risk areas and populations with low vaccination uptake, highlighting clusters of zero-dose children. Machine learning approaches, such as random forests or gradient boosting, can help detect patterns and risk factors associated with missed immunizations, including socioeconomic status, distance to health facilities, or maternal education. Time-series and forecasting models can also anticipate areas likely to experience drops in coverage due to seasonal, social, or logistical factors.

Furthermore, interactive visualization tools, such as dashboards or GIS heatmaps, can provide decision-makers with intuitive, actionable insights to target interventions efficiently. By combining predictive modelling with real-time monitoring, the Ministry of Health can optimize outreach campaigns, allocate resources more effectively, and ultimately reduce vaccine-preventable diseases.

How does maternal undernutrition during pregnancy influence the risk of childhood overweight and obesity, and how can this evidence inform nutrition and maternal-child health policies in Ethiopia?

2. Importance:
Childhood overweight and obesity are emerging public health concerns in Ethiopia, with long-term implications for non-communicable diseases. Understanding the link between maternal nutrition and early-life obesity is critical for designing interventions that prevent both undernutrition and future obesity. Evidence from this analysis can guide policymakers to prioritize maternal nutrition programs, optimize antenatal care strategies, and allocate resources effectively to reduce the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition.

3. Data and Modelling Approach:
Data from the KA-HDSS, including maternal anthropometry, dietary intake, pregnancy outcomes, and longitudinal child growth measures, would be used. A mixed-effects regression model (to account for repeated measurements within children and households) can quantify the association between maternal undernutrition and childhood BMI trajectories.

This lets programs locate communities with many zero-dose children (those who never received DTP1), quantify coverage gaps at fine scales, and predict where missed children live.
Key methods
•Small-area estimation & Bayesian geospatial models to produce district- or facility-level coverage estimates from sparse data.
•Machine learning and regression (including geographically weighted regression) to link zero-dose risk with predictors (distance to facility, maternal education, conflict, poverty, displacement).

As a biostatistician and public health researcher with extensive experience in advanced modelling and epidemiological analysis, I see this hackathon as a unique chance to apply my skills to practical policy challenges that have a direct impact on population health.
Participating in the hackathon will give me the chance to strengthen my hands-on modelling skills, experiment with innovative analytical approaches, and collaborate with a multidisciplinary team to develop practical solutions for pressing public health challenges.
Working with mentors from national and international institutions will broaden my perspective and help refine my modelling techniques. I am especially motivated by the opportunity to engage directly with public health decision-makers, ensuring that the solutions we develop are both practical and impactful. 
Overall, this hackathon offers an ideal platform to learn, innovate, and make a meaningful contribution to data-informed public health policy in Ethiopia.","I hope to contribute to the hackathon by applying Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling to improve the precision of estimates for immunization coverage and zero-dose prevalence. By combining prior knowledge with observed data, I aim to pinpoint areas with low immunization coverage, track trends in zero-dose populations, and provide more accurate, area-specific insights. These modelling-driven results can be shared directly with public health decision-makers to support targeted interventions that address local bottlenecks and make immunization programs more effective.
I also hope to learn from other participants how to use different modelling approaches to produce evidence that informs policy and drives real change. Engaging with decision-makers will teach me how to translate model outputs into actionable recommendations, design clear and impactful policy briefs, and understand what it takes to influence data-driven public health strategies. This experience will strengthen both my technical skills and my ability to contribute meaningfully to policy-relevant research.
","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue)","I will apply Bayesian spatio-temporal models, which offer several integrated advantages for improving immunization coverage and identifying zero-dose children in Ethiopia. By combining survey data, population estimates, and prior knowledge, these models produce precise, small-area estimates while quantifying uncertainty through credible intervals. They can predict in data-sparse or unsampled areas, improving decision-making in regions with limited information.
The spatio-temporal aspect captures both geographic heterogeneity and trends over time, enabling identification of areas where coverage is low, zero-dose prevalence is high, or trends are declining. Incorporating geospatial covariates such as travel time, population density, and health facility access allows detection of local bottlenecks that hinder vaccine uptake.
These outputs can generate high-resolution maps and absolute counts, which can be used to design tailored, context-specific interventions such as targeted outreach, mobile clinics, or catch-up programs ensuring resources are efficiently allocated and immunization inequities are addressed.","The public health policy question I am interested in exploring during the hackathon is: How can area-specific bottlenecks that limit immunization coverage and contribute to zero-dose children in Ethiopia be identified and addressed?
Despite national efforts such as catch-up campaigns, outreach, and quality improvement in routine immunization services, effective coverage remains low (~34%), and utilization varies widely across regions. Identifying area-specific bottlenecks is critical for designing tailored interventions that make efficient use of available resources and leverage locally appropriate solutions.
To address this question, I would use Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling, which integrates prior knowledge with observed data over space and time. This approach can generate precise, small-area estimates of immunization coverage, detect trends in zero-dose prevalence, and identify local bottlenecks. These insights can directly inform tailored interventions and guide policy decisions to improve immunization equity and effectiveness across Ethiopia

As my scientific interests are ideally aligned with the present opportunity, I see this hackathon as a unique chance to advance my experience in modelling and epidemiological analysis to practical policy challenges that have a direct impact on population health. 

I believe that partnerships and the application of advanced statistical and public health models to the real-world data in a way that meets the requirements of internal consistency and effectiveness will enable competitive individuals to develop practical and impactful solutions for pressing public health challenges. My research interests are closely related with the event's key areas, specifically immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, as well as vector-borne disease modeling. 
","I hope I will actively contribute through the application of Bayesian spatio-temporal modeling, which I believe has the capability to capture bottlenecks in immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation. This distinctive modeling produces more accurate estimates through combining time, place, and prior information interactions. Identifying hotspot areas and seasonal fluctuation, taking prior knowledge into account, will aid planners and policymakers in mitigating public health emergencies, vector control, and epidemics and ensuring efficient use of resources, the primary flaw in health systems to date.

Additionally, I anticipate that the knowledge and skills I gain from this event and other attendees will help me advance my work in this area. It will also provide a special and exciting basement for my future research career in conducting cutting-edge studies that can influence health policy. Lastly, it provides me with a chance to collaborate with decision-makers to convert study findings into data-driven public health strategies.
","Immunization coverage and zero-dose estimation, Vector-borne disease modelling (e.g., malaria, dengue)","Understanding regional, zonal, district, or cluster-level variation in zero-dose immunization is useful in identifying gaps in the performance of immunization programs and targeting low-coverage areas for supplemental immunization activities, which can boost the herd immunity and accelerate disease elimination. However, studies that attempted geographical analysis failed to quantify the relative risk (RR) because they ignored the possible significance of time and space interaction in zero-dose immunization.

The Bayesian spatio-temporal model, which I have an interest in conducting, can eliminate the shortcoming through taking the spatio-temporal structure as a priori, accounting for the influence of neighboring temporal and spatial structure. This modeling approach can realize the simultaneous analysis of temporal, spatial, and spatio-temporal interactions and potential influencing factors of zero-dose immunization. Additional uncertainties will be included in order to more precisely estimate the RR of zero-dose immunization as well as geographical and temporal fluctuation in its incidence and contributing factors.

Therefore, by identifying regions with high zero-dose prevalence and low immunization coverage, as well as spatial heterogeneity factors like access to health facilities, policymakers can identify local bottlenecks that impede vaccine uptake and implement context-specific interventions that ensure resources are allocated efficiently and immunization disparities are addressed.
","""Which areas of Ethiopia are under-served by immunization programs, how might these gaps evolve over time, and what are spatial heterogeneity factors?"" is the public health policy question that I would like to investigate during the hackathon.

Despite efforts to strengthen the immunization coverage, including community outreach programs about the importance of vaccination through the involvement of community leaders, immunization coverage remains low. Disparities in income, education, access to healthcare services, household factors, health priorities, and cultural beliefs contribute to the uneven distribution of vaccine uptake.

The Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling will be used to answer this research question using a series of household/individual surveys like DHS, MICS, and national immunization coverage surveys, as well as administrative routine data such as EPI/HMIS.
